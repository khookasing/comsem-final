Stars shining bright above youNight breezes seem to whisper 'I love you'Birds singin' in the sycamore treeDream a little dream of meSay nighty-night and kiss meJust hold me tight and tell me you'll miss meWhile I'm alone and blue as can beDream a little dream of meStars fading but I linger on dearStill craving your kissI'm longing to linger till dawn dearJust saying this Sweet dreams till sunbeams find youSweet dreams that leave all worries behind youBut in your dreams whatever they beDream a little dream of meStars fading but I linger on dearStill craving your kissI'm longing to linger till dawn dearJust saying thisSweet dreams till sunbeams find youSweet dreams that leave all worries far behind youBut in your dreams whatever they beDream a little dream of me
