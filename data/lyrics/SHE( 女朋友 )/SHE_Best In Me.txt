From the moment I met you I just knew you'd be mineYou touched my handAnd I knew that this was gonna be our timeI don't ever wanna lose this feelingI don't wanna spend a moment apartChorus:'Cos you bring out the best in me, like no-one else can doThat's why I'm by your side, and that's why I love youEvery day that I'm here with youI know that it feels rightAnd I've just got to be near you every day and every night And you know that we belong togetherIt just had to be you and meChorus...And you know that we belong together, It just had to be you and me'Cos you bring out the best in me, like no-one else can doThat's why I'm by your side'Cos you bring out the best in me, like no-one else can doThat's why I'm by your side, and that's why I love you'Cos you bring out the best in me, like no-one else can doThat's why I'm by your side, and that's why I love you
