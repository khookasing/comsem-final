Remember whenWe never needed each otherThe best of friendsLike sister and brotherWe understoodWe'd never beAloneThose days are goneNow I want you so muchThe night is longAnd I need your touchDon't know what to sayNever meant to feel this wayDon't wanna be alone tonightCHORUSWhat can I do to make you mineFalling so hard, so fast this timeWhat did I say, what did you doHow did I fall in love with you I hear your voiceAnd I start to trembleBrings back the childThat I resembleI cannot pretendThat we can still be friendsDon't wanna be alone tonightCHORUS - repeatI wanna say this rightAnd it has to be tonightJust need you to knowI don't wanna live this lieI don't wanna say goodbyeWith you I wanna spend the rest of my lifeCHORUS - repeatWhat can I do to make yu mineFalling so hard, so fast this timeEverything's changed, we never knewHow did I fall in love with you
