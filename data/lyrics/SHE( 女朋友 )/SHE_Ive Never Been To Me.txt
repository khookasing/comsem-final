Hey lady, you, lady, cursing at your lifeYou're a discontented mother and a regimented wifeI've no doubt you dream about the things you'll never doBut I wish someone had talked to me like I wanna talk to youI've been to Georgia and California and anywhere I could runI took the hand of a preacher man and we made love in the sunBut I ran out of places and friendly faces because I had to be freeI've been to paradise but I've never been to mePlease, lady, please, lady, don't just walk away'Cause I have this need to tell you why I'm all alone todayI can see so much of me still living in your eyes won't you share a part of a weary heart that has lived million liesOoh I've been to Nice and the Isle of Greece while I've sipped champagne on a yachtI've moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo and showed them what I've gotI've been undressed by kingsAnd I've seen some things that a woman ain't supposed to seeI've been to paradise but I've never been to meSometimes I've been to crying for unborn children that might have made me completebut I, I took the sweet life I never knew I'd be bitter from the sweetI've spent my life exploring the subtle whoring that costs too much to be freeHey lady,I've been to paradise but I've never been to meI've been to paradise but I've never been to me
