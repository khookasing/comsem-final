I never had a dream come trueEverybody's got somethingThey had to leave behindOne regret from yesterdayThat just seems to grow with timeThere's no use looking back or wonderingHow it could be nowor might have beenAll this I know but still I can't find waysTo let you goChorus:I never had a dream come trueTill the day that found youEven though I pretend that I moved onYou'll always be my babyI never found the words to sayYou're the one I think about each dayAnd I know no matter Where life takes me toA part of me will always be with you.Somewhere in my memoryI've lost a sense of timeAnd tomorrow can never beCause yesterday is all that fills my mind(Chorus)You'll always be the dreamThat fills my headYou'll always be the one IknowI'll never forgetIt's no use looking back or wonderingBecause love is a strange and funny thingNo matter how I try and tryI just can't say goodbye
