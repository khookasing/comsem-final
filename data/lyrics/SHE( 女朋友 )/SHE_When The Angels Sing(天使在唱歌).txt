And when the angels singI want you by my sideI don't care how long I've been waiting for my babyAnd when the angels bringYou back here in my lifeThen I know it's trueThat I love youI was so blindI was so wrongThe day we met it never leaves my mindI thought you play some foolish gameBut now my heart tells me I was wrongAnd when you come around I let you insideCause I'm ready I can't wait anymoreAnd when the angels singI want you by my sideI don't care how long I've been waiting for my babyAnd when the angels bringYou back here in my lifeThen I know it's trueThat I love youEach night I pray that you'll come backI can't deny what I feel insideThe music plays one special songThe words that they say I hope can bring you homeAnd when you come around I let you insideCause I'm ready I can't wait anymore And when the angels singI want you by my sideI don't care how long I've been waiting for my babyAnd when the angels bringYou back here in my lifeThen I know it's trueThat I love youI know I've cried so many timesI know I've said things I was running awayI was wrongAnd when the angels singI want you by my sideI don't care how long I've been waiting for my babyAnd when the angels singI want you by my sideI don't care how long I've been waiting for my babyAnd when the angels bringYou back here in my lifeThen I know it's trueThat I love youAnd when the angels singI want you by my sideI don't care how long I've been waiting for my babyAnd when the angels bringYou back here in my lifeThen I know it's trueThat I love you
