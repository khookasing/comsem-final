Life is a moment in space, when the dream is gone,it's a lonelier place.I kiss the morning goodbye, but down inside,you know we never know why.The road is narrow and long, when eyes meet eyes,and the feeling is strong.I turn away from the wall, I stumble and fall,but I give you it all.* I am a woman in love, and I do anything,　to get you into my world, and hold you within.　It's a right,I defend, over and over again, What do I do? With you eternally mind, in love there is no measure of time.We planned it all at the start.That you and I would live in each other's hearts？We may be oceans away, you feel my love, I hear what you say.No truth is ever a lie, I stumble and fall, But I give you it all.Repeat *I am a woman in love, and I'm talking to you, I know how you feels,What a woman can do, It's a right I defend over and over again.Repeat *
