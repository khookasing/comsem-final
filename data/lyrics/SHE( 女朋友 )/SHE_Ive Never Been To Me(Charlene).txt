Hey lady, you lady, cursing at your lifeYou're a discontented mother and a regimented wifeI've no doubt you dream about the things you'll never doBut, I wish someone had talked to meLike I wanna talk to you.....Oh, I've been to Georgia and California and anywhere I could runI took the hand of a preacher man and we made love in the sunBut I ran out of places and friendly faces because I had to be freeI've been to paradise but I've never been to me Please lady, please lady, don't just walk away'Cause I have this need to tell you why I'm all alone todayI can see so much of me still living in your eyesWon't you share a part of a weary heart that has lived million lies....Oh, I've been to Niece and the Isle of Greece while I've sipped champagne on a yachtI've moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo and showed 'em what I've gotI've been undressed by kings and I've seen some things that a woman ain't supposed to seeI've been to paradise, but I've never been to me
