When I was just a little girlMy momma used to tuck me into bedand she'd read me a storyIt always was about a Princess in distress And how a guy would save her and end up with the gloryI'd lie in bed and think about the person that I want to beThen one day I realized the fairy tale life wasn't for me[Chorus]I don't wanna be like CinderellaSittin' in a dark old dusty cellarWaiting for somebody, to come and set me freeI don't wanna be like Snow White waitingFor a handsome prince to come and save meOn a horse of white, unless we're riding side by sideDon't want to depend on no one elseI'd rather rescue myselfSomeday I'm gonna find someone who wants my soul, heart, and mindWho's not afraid to show that he loves meSomebody who will understand I'm happy just the way I amDon't need nobody taking care of meI will be there for him just as strong as he will be there for meWhen I give myself then it has to got to be, an equal thing[Chorus]I can slay, my own dragonsI can dream, my own dreamsMy knight in shining armour is meSo I'm gonna set me free[Chorus x3]
