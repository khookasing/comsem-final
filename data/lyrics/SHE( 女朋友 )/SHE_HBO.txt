Seems all the stars are falling apart for me and youAnd I feel happy happy, I'm so happy when I fall in loveBecause I'm happy happy, I'm so happy when I fall in loveRain drops keep falling all the Wednesday till midnight But I can feel the sunshine you give me on the lineAnd you say babe babe, I'm your babe when you fall in loveYou call me babe babe, I'm your babe when you fall in loveThank god it's Friday I can't wait to be with youAll night we walk into the moonlight rainbow dreamAnd you're my only only, I'm your only when we fall in loveNow we're happy, babe, love's the only thing for you and me
