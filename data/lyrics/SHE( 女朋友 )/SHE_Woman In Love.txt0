life is a moment in spacewhen the dream is goneit's alonelier placei kiss the morning goodbyebut down inside you knowwe never know whythe road is narrow and longwhen eyes meet eyesand the feeling is strongi turn away from the walli stumble and fall but i give you it alli am a woman in loveand i do anything to get you into my worldand hold you withinit's a right i defend over and over again what do i dowith you eternally minein lvoe there is no measure of timewe planned it all at the startthat you and i would live in each other's heartswe may be oceans awayyou feel my love i hear what you sayno truth is ever a lie is tumble and fallbut l give you it alli am a woman in loveand i'm talking to youi know how it feelswhat a woman can doit's right i defend over and over again
