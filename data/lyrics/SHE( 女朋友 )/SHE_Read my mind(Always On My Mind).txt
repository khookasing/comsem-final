(Verse 1)In your eyes you look so wearyFighting light with dark and drearyAnd even though you cant hear meI'll still singYou go to church and pray on SundayYou think your sins are cleaned that awayDont't know forgiveness just begins with you(Chorus)If you could read my mindJust read my mindThen you could see what's behind my eyesIf you could read my mindGet your hand untiedCause the battlefield is tired(Verse 2)Get a little bit stupid sometimesGet a litlle bit jealous sometimes Sometimes Ill be unfair but that's just meBut I know that I'm not hidingAnd I wont let your chains bind meBecause perfection is not the point of this(Chorus twice)(Bridge)If love made senseThen I think there would be a bookTo tell us who is really right and wrongBut I don't want something simpleI don't want to sing a normal songLet's just close our eyes and let it beCause the battelefield is tired(Crous repeats)Let's just close our eyes and let it beCause the battelefield is tired
