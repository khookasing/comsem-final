Baby want you tell me why there is sadness in your eyesI don't wanna say goodbye to youLove is one big illusion I should try to forgetBut there is something left in my headYou're the one who set it upNow you're the one to make it stopI'm the one who's feeling lost right nowNow you want me to forget every little thing you saidBut there is something left in my head* CHORUS : I won't forget the way you're kissingThe feelings so strong were lasting for so longBut I'm not the man your heart is missingThat's why you go away I know You were never satisfied no matter how I triedNow you wanna say goodbye to meLove is one big illusion I should try to forgetBut there is something left in my head* REPEAT CHORUSSitting here all alone in the middle of nowhereDon't know which way to goThere is so much to say now between usThere ain't so much for youThere ain't so much for me anymore* REPEAT CHORUS
