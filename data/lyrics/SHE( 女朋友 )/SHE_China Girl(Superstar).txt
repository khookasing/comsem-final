Life，hold my breath，I am drowning in my dread.The wind is getting strong，The wind is getting stronger.There is no second chance when the devils make you dance.The sky is getting dark，the sky is getting dark.Can't you see，can't you see we've never meant to be.It's no secret that I'm your china girl.Don't you know，don't you know that it's time for me to go.It's no secret that I'm your china girl.No turning back，no questions left to ask.The tide is getting high，the tide is getting higher.I'm not afraid I decided that it's all mistake.It's time to face the storm，it's time to face the storm.Can't you see，can't you see we've never meant to be.It's no secret that I'm your china girl.Don't you know，don't you know that it's time for me to go. It's no secret that I'm your china girl.You live you learn，and right now my storm that'll burn，but I won't hide，the blame was mine.Hold my breath，I am drowning in my dread.The wind is getting strong，The wind is getting stronger.There is no second chance when the devils make you dance.The sky is getting dark，the sky is getting dark.Can't you see，can't you see we've never meant to be.It's no secret that I'm your china girl.Don't you know，don't you know that it's time for me to go.It's no secret that I'm your china girl .Can't you see，can't you see we've never meant to be.It's no secret that I'm your china girl.Don't you know，don't you know that it's time for me to go.It's no secret that I'm your china girl.
